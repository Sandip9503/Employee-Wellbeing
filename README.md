# Employee-Wellbeing

Problem Statement:
Develop a machine learning model to predict whether an employee requires treatment based on various workplace and personal attributes. The goal is to analyze factors affecting employee wellness and generate accurate predictions for the given test dataset. The model's predictions will help organizations design targeted wellness programs and improve employee well-being.
